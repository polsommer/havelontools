Building MonAPI on most UN*X and UN*X-like systems, simply
./configure --with-udplibrary=/path/to/udplibrary --prefix=`pwd`
make install

This will use the version of Jeff Petersen's UdpLibrary specified
on the configure command line, and install the monAPI library
in a subdirectory of the build directory called lib.

A static and shared library will be created.
