	-	Added a description field to the connect message for loggin 
		purposes server side.
	-	Remove the use of enumeration types as api & message values.  
		They are all typedefs now.
	-	Removed ability to cancel requests.
	-	Removed asyncronous execution mode.

	-	Added new message definition macros to support members of an 
		enumerated type.  This was done to be compatable with gcc 2.95
	-	Made apiResult an unsigned integer type rather than an
		enumerated type.  This was done in order to allow result values
		to be defined in specific api's without conflicting with 
		CommonAPI result values.
	-	Added virtual 'Notify' callback functions that correspond to 
		the connection status callbacks passed to the applications.
		These functions can be used for the api to change its internal
		state based on these events.
	-	Added virtual functions for an api to specify 'PortAliveDelay',
		'NoDataTimeout' and 'UnacknowledgedDataTimeout' values in
		addition to the 'KeepAliveDelay' value.
	-	Changed the failed connection retry delay from 6 seconds to
		1 second.
	-	Made the server selection for connectivity semi-random.

	-	Fixed Bug: Tracked requests that failed before being sent due 
		to bad parameters where still being added to the output queue
		even though the result was generated immidiately.  I forced the
		deletion of the request from the queue if the result is known
		up front.
	-	Added a keep-alive support to the basic api model.  This allows
		servers to do implicit closure of connections after a period of
		inactivity.
	-	Modified linux.mak to build in directories that don't include 
		the platform prefix.  "linux-release" -> "release"
	-	Modified source so that a single-threaded build of the API can
		be performed by not defining the _REENTRANT or _MT flag.  If 
		compiled single-threaded, the asynchronous flag in the 
		constructor is ignored.
