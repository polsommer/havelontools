2007.7.20
	-	Added GrantFeatureByStationID. Like GrantFeature_v2 but it takes
		a station ID, instead of a Session ID.
2007.7.15
	-	Added ModifyFeature_v2 which updates the feature based on 
		station id and game code.  It also takes in the original 
		string data.  This will insures that the feature has not 
		been updated since it was retrieved.  If the current feature 
		does not match the pass in string then it will fail.
2007.7.10
	-	Added GrantFeature_v2 - this allows games to grant a feature 
		in another game for that user.
2002.12.03
	-	Modified  session kick mechanism to support automatic kicking 
		and requested session kicks.
	-	Modified bulke touch and logout requests to simplify the model
		for doing lookups within the session server.  Only session
		tickets (ids) will be valid lookup keys.  This removes support 
		for calls taking session type/account id pairs.
2002.11.20
	-	Implemented support for multiple simultaneous connections 
		to allow load-balancing accross Session Login Servers.
	-	Removed SecureIdPrompt parameter from password validation
		calls.  In stead, the result code will reflect the action
		necessary to proceed with secure login.
2002.10.29
	-	Modified api interface to support the following: 
		[a] provider id in session and subscription objects
		[b] force login parameter in login that give the client
		ability to request session kick
		[c] secureIdPrompt parameter in callbacks that accept
		a user name and password
		[d] added maxConnections parameter to the Client ctor to allow
		support for load balanced request distribution in the future
		[e] added overloaded ctor that accepts a space delimited 
		server list
		[f] removed asyncronous execution mode
2002.08.26
	-	Added support for specifying a keepAliveDelay in the API.
2002.07.24
	-	Modified linux.mak to build in directories that don't include 
		the platform prefix.  "linux-release" -> "release"
	-	Modified source so that a single-threaded build of the API can
		be performed by not defining the _REENTRANT or _MT flag.  If 
		compiled single-threaded, the asynchronous flag in the 
		constructor is ignored.
