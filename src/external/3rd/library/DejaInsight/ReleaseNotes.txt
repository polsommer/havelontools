DejaInsight release notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.2152
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added "Add IPs" and "Add Applications" buttons to the Deja Launcher activity 
   log panel. The buttons will be enabled when you select one or more log 
   entries that have an IP or Application name not in your filter lists. 
   Clicking the button adds all selected IPs or Application Names to the 
   appropriate filter lists. Duplicates will not be added.
 - Added support for setting the hardware thread on which the Deja threads 
   execute through the use of:
     DEJA_SET_PARAMETER( DEJA_XBOX360_THREAD_PROCESSOR, n ).

Fixes
 - Fixed double clicking in the Launcher session list to load old sessions when 
   there is a space in the Temporary folder path.
 - Fixed a minor memory leak in the Launcher related to the log view.
 - Fixed an error in the Heap API mismatch error detection logic that resulted 
   in false positives.
 - Fixed potential crash bug when executing a "Goto Item" in an empty list 
   view.
 - Added code to restore the Notification Icon for Launcher if explorer.exe is 
   restarted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.2090 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added an "Enabled" column to the bookmarks window. Bookmarks are enabled by 
   default. When disabled the bookmarks are skipped by F2, shift-F2 operations 
   and they are not considered in the "surrounding bookmarks" time range mode. 
   This lets you quickly disable bookmarks that are interfering with your 
   profile ranges without deleting them.
 - Improved Deja Flush thread performance. The thread used to wake up every 
   10ms, it now only wakes every 500ms.
 - Color coding in the heap graph now shows all blocks allocated within the 
   selected time range in red, if there is no range then the last 1% of blocks 
   allocated are shown as red.

Fixes
 - The "Log only known IP's" state is now saved between runs of Deja Launcher.
 - Fixed a minor repaint bug where bookmarks toggled with ctrl-F2 were not 
   immediately shown in the object watch window.
 - Fixed display of context menu from launcher tray icon when the taskbar is 
   not at the bottom of the screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.2007 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added new error messages to better explain DejaLib instrumentation problems 
   in the object tracking system.
 - Added right click menu to the Deja Launcher tray icon.
 - The END key in log views will now attach the view back to time so the view 
   will scroll with new data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1995 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Revised the unhandled exception handler to more reliably create Minidump 
   files when an exception occurs in other threads.
 - Added Shift+Delete, Ctrl+Insert, Shift+Insert keys for Cut, Copy, Paste in 
   edit controls.
 - Using DEJA_SET_AUTO_FLUSH now generates a warning message in the trace log.
 - Added basic free block information to the heap graph view when the mouse 
   cursor hovers over an area with no allocations.
 - Added column showing total bytes posted to the Types view.
 - Find next / prev warning in the channel tree now finds warnings and errors.
 - Find next / prev warning in the heap log now finds warnings and errors.
 - The heap log now shows mismatched Heap API calls in red, for example a 
   malloc followed by a delete. These errors are also tracked in the trace log.
 - Changed the close button on Deja Launcher to close the application with an 
   are you sure prompt.
 - Changed Escape in Deja Launcher to warn that it will minimize the window to 
   the tray.
 - Changed Minimize in Deja Launcher to warn that it will minimize the window 
   to the tray.
 - Added persistence of the type view visible checkboxes across sessions.

Fixes
 - Fixed crash when trying to paste in an edit control with an empty clipboard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1945 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added a 'Show All Channels' option to the trace channels context menu.
 - Added a 'Goto Type' option to the object log context menu.
 - Added a 'Show All Types' option to the types view context menu.
 - Removed Debug versions of the deja libraries from the distribution and 
   renamed the libraries to 'DejaLib.Win32.lib', 'DejaDLL.Win32.dll', and 
   'DejaLib.X360.lib'.
 - The type view can now be used to filter the object log using the 'visible' 
   checkboxes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1909 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added a types view with cross referencing to the objects window and 
   statistics for the total instances and posts for each object type.
 - Added Visual Studio style ctrl+Tab processing with a window stack. ctrl+Tab 
   cycles backwards and ctrl+shift+Tab cycles forwards through the stack. This 
   works well to set focus back after it is changed by a double click in the 
   object log or heap log/graph windows.
 - Double clicking in the heap log activates or creates a heap graph window and 
   zoom into that block.
 - Double clicking a block in the heap graph activates or creates a heap log 
   window and goes to the log entry for that block.
 - Double clicking in the object log activates or creates an object watch 
   window and adds that object to the watch list.
 - Added keys * and / and shift or ctrl-Click to recursively open or close tree 
   nodes.

Fixes
 - Fixed selection logic in some windows for reversed selections.
 - Fixed goto next and previous cross reference in the object log view.
 - Fixed saving channel tree state expanded states when right / left keys are 
   used to open and close tree nodes.
 - Fixed problem of sometimes creating new windows off screen when monitor 
   configuration is changed.
 - Fixed column separator double click auto sizing to include the last visible 
   line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1864 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added DEJA_SET_VALUE( Name, Value ) macro to give the application control 
   over certain Deja Insight parameters. The first supported variables are:
   - Frame.Warn.fps
   - Frame.Warn.ms
   - Frame.Error.fps
   - Frame.Error.ms
   - For example to set the warning indicator at 30fps and the error at 20fps in 
     the frame view:
   - DEJA_SET_VALUE( "Frame.Warn.fps" , 30 );
   - DEJA_SET_VALUE( "Frame.Error.fps", 20 );
 - The trace log view now more accurately tracks focus between repeated 
   filtering operations. It now seeks to a time index rather than a list item 
   number.
 - Added Enabled columns to IP and App filter tabs in Deja Launcher to quickly 
   disable or enable entries without deleting and recreating them.

Fixes
 - Fixed rare Insight crash when viewing VLA's in an Object Watch view.
 - Fixed crash in Launcher when the session status hasn't updated to closed
   and the session is double clicked in an attempt to open the Insight.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1813 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added support to allow DEJA_OBJECT_INIT and DEJA_POST to accept arrays of 
   objects.
 - Added DEJA_IF_PTR and DEJA_CSTRING for use within DejaDescriptor functions.
 - DEJA_IF_PTR will post the content of the given pointer if it is non-null.  
   Note that it will only post a single instance of the target type.  To post 
   multiple instances of the target type (thus a variable length array), use 
   DEJA_VLARRAY.
 - DEJA_CSTRING will post a standard, NULL-terminated C string.
 - DEJA_VLARRAY will now show the address specified by the given pointer even 
   if the specified count is zero.
 - Variable length string fields (described via either DEJA_CSTRING or 
   DEJA_VLARRAY) will show the string when "closed" in an Object Watch window, 
   and the address and element range when "open".
 - When an object having VLA fields is added to an Object Watch window, Insight 
   will automatically set the count based on the largest size of the VLA within 
   10 posts of the current time index.  Similarly, when you double click on a 
   VLA field type in an Object Watch, the Count field is prepopulated with the 
   VLA maximum size within 10 post of the current time index.
 - Restructured the data posting system (DEJA_POST) in the process of adding 
   support for variable length arrays within objects (via DEJA_VLARRAY).
 - The DEJA_FIELD command now understands static sized arrays directly.  The 
   DEJA_ARRAY command is aliased to DEJA_FIELD for now, but will be retired in 
   future releases.
 - Previous post functionality:
 - DEJA_FIELD( Object.m_Array ); // output = address of the array
 - DEJA_ARRAY( Object.m_Array ); // output = contents of entire array
 - New post functionality:
 - DEJA_FIELD( Object.m_Array ); // output = contents of entire array
 - Added a new cell highlight to show which cell in causing a cross reference 
   highlight on a row.
 - Added Object and Context cross referencing to the heap log.
 - Hooked up Next/Prev Warning/Error navigation in the frame log. This makes it 
   very easy to find bad frames.
 - Modified the way setting the start and end points for custom time ranges 
   works to be more intuitive.

Fixes
 - Fixed F10 and shift-F10 navigation to next and previous active allocation in 
   heap log.
 - Fixed pinning Launcher to start menu, it is now able to find Insight 
   correctly.
 - Fixed browse for layout in the Insight options dialog.
 - Improved coherency of window layouts between Insight sessions controlled by 
   Launcher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1748 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added new buffering scheme for heap free operations. These are costly to 
   write into the database, with each free potentially causing a disk seek. The 
   new buffer helps smooth out the hit from a large number of free operations 
   in a short space of time, like a game level unload.
 - Insight now creates Object Log and Object Watch views as necessary to 
   satisfy the user Goto Object and Add Object to Watch requests.
 - Added 'Goto Object' and 'Add Object to Watch' options to the heap log 
   context menu.
 - Added Object and Context cross references to the heap log.
 - Added 'Add Object to Watch' option to the object log context menu.
 - Added 'Add Object to Watch' option to the trace log context menu.
 - Modified Deja Launcher "Concurrent Insight" limit to not shut down active 
   sessions, that is Deja Insight instances that are still connected to their 
   client applications. This makes the limit more of a target that can be 
   exceeded if you have a lot of active processes. As the client applications 
   close the corresponding Insight will close if the active number is above the 
   limit.
 - Added a new "custom" range mode to the time bar. The start and end times can 
   be set manually.
 - Insight no longer adds session filenames loaded by double clicking on them 
   in Launcher to the recent files list. This avoids all the GUIDs in the 
   recent file list.

Fixes
 - Save configuration when the 'Yield' button is toggled by the user. This 
   improves the coherency of settings between Insight sessions created by 
   Launcher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1710 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Contexts from the Trace, Heap, and Object Logs now only cross reference to 
   the specific instance of the context within the Context Tree.  Previously 
   cross referenced to all instances in the tree.
 - Heap tracking version 2. A rewrite of the heap tracking system in Insight to 
   improve performance and storage efficiency.

Fixes
 - Changed Insight to save the Channel view state whenever the state is changed 
   by a user interface operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1686 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes
 - Fixed XBox360 compatibility with DejaLauncher and added an additional error 
   message to the log to help diagnose connection problems.
 - There was an execution path during the rendering of the Context List which 
   did not properly lock shared data for access.  If the timing was just right 
   (that is, seemingly at random), the data could be read during the middle of 
   a larger atomic update which was resulting in an access violation (null 
   pointer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1665 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Trace Log view modified to include the full context tree in the context 
   column.
 - Added a basic "frames" view that shows information about each frame 
   including duration and heap activity.
 - Improved the sessions tab in Deja Launcher. There are now fields to show the 
   status of the session "Active, Open, Closed" and related color coding. There 
   is also a new column to shown which platform the application connected from.

Fixes
 - Added a watchdog event to Deja Launcher to verify the status of any child 
   Deja Insight processes. This catches the case where Insight has either 
   crashed or been killed by task manager, etc.
 - Resolved problem with creating new temporary folders that already exist, 
   also now tests to make sure it is a folder and not a file.
 - Fixed a Deja Launcher crash that can occur after running for a long period 
   of time.
 - Fixed a Deja Launcher deadlock that can occur when managing large numbers of 
   processes.
 - Fixed the window title in Deja Insight so that it displays the name of the 
   connected application or the filename of a loaded session.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1603 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added support for projects where wchar_t is not a built-in type.  (For 
   example: Developer Studio 2003 projects using default compiler settings.)
 - Extended the formatted output specifications. %hs indicates a narrow string 
   argument, and %ls indicates a wide string argument.  The interpretation of 
   %hs and %ls is not affected by the width of the format string (unlike %s and 
   %S).
 - Launcher now processes a double click in the session list to show the 
   Insight instance associated with that session or to launch a new Insight 
   with the old session loaded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1589 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Improved the Export Active Heap feature.  The process should be 
   substantially faster.  New data fields have been added: context, scoped 
   object, heap function, and source.
 - Added a spinner control to the launcher sessions tab to control the number 
   of old sessions kept in the temporary folder.
 - Context Tree view will remember the open/closed state of each node in the 
   tree.
 - When Insight is launched in stealth mode it will now automatically exit when 
   the client application disconnects.
 - Added a free drive space check and warning dialog to Launcher when it runs.
 - Added free drive space check to Launcher to prevent launching Insight and 
   flag an error message in the activity log if free space is too low.
 - Added free drive space check to Insight on startup in standalone mode. It 
   will display an error dialog and close if free space is too low.
 - Added an Insight launch mode control to Deja Launcher. Insight can be set to 
   launch in Stealth, Minimized, Normal or Maximized modes of operation.
 - When in frame time range mode and watching live time, the last COMPLETE 
   frame will be used as the time range.  This improves the "experience 
   quality" when watching the Context List view in Live Time with Frame Time 
   Range selected.
 - Added cross references based on context to Context List, Context Tree, Heap 
   Log, and Trace Log.
 - Added a "Log only known IP's" checkbox to the Launcher activity log. This 
   will only log traffic from the IP's in your IP filter list when enabled, it 
   logs all traffic when disabled.
 - Channel Visibile and Enabled states are now linked to the client application 
   name and the last 2000 states are retained, not just the states from the 
   last session captured.

Fixes
 - Fixed crash when no bookmarks were set and the Bookmark Time Range mode was 
   engaged.
 - All strings (channels, labels, format strings, %s arguments) are now clipped 
   to a maximum of 1024 characters (either narrow or wide).
 - Fixed Arg0 processing in DejaLib when there are spaces in the path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1554 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - The functionality of the Timebar sync buttons in the heap log and object log 
   has changed to allow cursor navigation within the views without altering the 
   state of the views.
 - The Time Bar now takes keyboard focus when clicked with the mouse. This
   allows for accurate bookmark setting and navigation with F2 keys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1526 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Changed ctrl-F in the heap log view to a text find dialog.
 - Removed the IP Filter checkbox from the launcher, it always filters now.
 - New buttons on tool bar to set range modes.  Available modes are "Start to 
   Cursor" (normal operation), "Surround Bookmarks", and "Surrounding Frame".  
   The range mode currently only affects the two context views.

Fixes
 - Fixed crash when loading a saved session failed.
 - Fixed state of channel visibility checkboxes when loading a saved session.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1510 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Removed templates from the object system interface.
 - Added class as an argument to DEJA_BASE (within a DejaDescriptor). This 
   fixes support for multiple inheritance by allowing multiple DEJA_BASE 
   statements in a Descriptor.
 - Reversed the order of parameters to DEJA_TYPE and DEJA_ENUM (within a 
   DejaDescriptor) to improve code readability.
 - Added support for wide file names to the heap functions.
 - DEJA_SET_AUTO_FLUSH now only accepts a bool value.
 - Default parameter to DEJA_FLUSH is now true.
 - Retired DEJA_STRING.  Use DEJA_ARRAY for fixed length character arrays.
 - In the Object Watch view, the labels <create> and <destroy> have been 
   changed to <INIT> and <KILL> to correspond better with DEJA_OBJECT_INIT and 
   DEJA_OBJECT_KILL.
 - Added a "Disconnect" button to the toolbar that closes the connection 
   between Insight and the user application. The button also reflects the 
   connection status.
 - In the context List, contexts with all hits in the "future" are now colored 
   "future blue".
 - Added a new Goto command bound to ctrl-G in log views for direct access by 
   item number.
 - Modified Trace Log view to keep the current focus item (or the remaining 
   closest item) centered after filtering.
 - Added column sort information to saved layout.
 - Context List sort defaults to Global %.

Fixes
 - Fixed Channel enabled and visible state Save / Load.
 - Fixed a major slowdown in the heap tracking system.
 - Fixed memory leak when searching in log views with no entries.
 - Removed case sensitivity on command line options.
 - Stopped duplicate entry of objects into watch window when double clicking in 
   the object log.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1380 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Trace Channels View: Added context menu commands "Hide Selected Channels", 
   "Show Selected Channels" and "Show Only Selected Channels".
 - Added "current time active context" highlight to Context List.
 - Changed the Trace Log "Hide channel" context menu option to "Hide Selected 
   Channels".
 - Added double click support to Context List.
 - Added support for sorting columns to Context List.
 - Added a Bookmarks view for managing bookmarks. The view displays the time, 
   source view and an editable comment for each bookmark.
 - Alphabetically order siblings in the Context Tree.
 - Highlight the current conext (for each thread) in the Context Tree.
 - Color "future" data blue in the Context Tree.
 - Added more context menu options (find, next cross reference, next same 
   context) to the Context Tree pane.
 - Dialogs now remember their position instead of defaulting to the center of 
   their parent window. This position is also saved with the window layout.
 - Restore focus to the correct panel when switching away then back to Deja 
   Insight with mouse or Alt-TAB.
 - Modified list views to center items when the user goes to an item that is 
   off screen through a menu command or accelerator. For example using the 
   function keys or find dialog.

Fixes
 - Trace Log View: Changed the "Hide Channels" context command to "Hide 
   Selected Channels" and fixed the functionality to hide all selected instead 
   of just the focus item.
 - As nodes were added to the Context Tree, the "focus" item would not always 
   "follow" its data.  Fixed.  Also, if the focus was visible before data is 
   added, then the tree list will automatically scroll to keep the focus in 
   view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1303 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Insight displays an error if a non-literal string is used in DEJA_CONTEXT.

Fixes
 - Fixed shutdown of DejaLib in the situation where the threads have been 
   terminated without notification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1287 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added F2 and shift-F2 handling for next and previous bookmark to all windows.

Fixes
 - Fixed problem of skipping adjacent bookmarks in logs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1283 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added support for displaying type long and 64 bit integers via DEJA_TRACE.  
   "%d"=int, "%ld"=long, and "%lld"="long long" or int64.
 - New Drag and Drop interface for adding objects to watch windows.
 - Changed list copy behavior. ctrl+C copies the visible columns, shift+ctrl+C 
   copies the selected columns.
 - Added drag and drop from object list to object watch window.
 - Added more support for formatted output specifications.  All valid format 
   specifications should now be accepted.  Note that the flags, width, and 
   precision specifications are parsed but not used when generating output at 
   this time.

Fixes
 - Copy columns selection wasn't working correctly when columns were reordered.
 - DejaLib could not find Insight on the same machine when there were no 
   network connections.  Fixed.
 - Reworked the atomic type DejaDescriptor declarations.  This allows fields of 
   type "long" and "long long" to work now.
 - Escape now clears the selection in the object watch window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1259 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added new context menu option to the trace log view to hide this channel.
 - Changed object watch column size algorithm to use the target as a minimum.

Fixes
 - Insight was crashing when trying to report E4000 (object collision from 
   DEJA_OBJECT_INIT).  It was trying to get the name of the "new" object before 
   it had been registered with the system.  Fix: If there is a collision, set a 
   flag and save the name of the old object, then proceed with the new object, 
   and finally report the error.
 - Fixed object watch display of u64 and s64 types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1252 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added Goto Object context menu choice in the trace log view.

Fixes
 - Fixed Windows XP classic mode rendering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.9.1250 Alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes
 - Added Context menu with Goto Source to context list and tree views.
 - Removed "gray" bitmaps for channels with errors and warnings.
 - Added "Child Logs" subtotals to channel tree view.
 - Added find / warning / error navigation controls to the channel tree view.
 - Added persistence to channel Collapsed / Expanded states.
 - Added processing of DEJA_APP_LABEL to set the main window title. Unless the
   session is saved, then the filename is used.
 - Optimizations to channel handling in support of dynamic channels.
 - Added context menu option for goto channel to Trace View.

Fixes
 - Fixed right arrow to expand tree node in channel tree view.
 - Added check in new frame creation to ensure it is visible on a monitor.
 - Added Escape to clear selection event handler to the context list view.
 - Added Escape to clear selection event handler to the context tree view.
