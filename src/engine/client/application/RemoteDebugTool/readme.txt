This is the readme.txt file for the remoteDebugTool application.  It is a tool developed by 
Sony Online Entertainment (i.e. Verant Interactive), authored by Eric Sebesta.  It uses the 
Qt GUI framework to allow multi-platform support, and because MFC is just no fun.

Note:  This application uses a Qt application called moc to generate additonal cpp files (all
prepended with "moc_" from corresponding h files.


MSDev build instructions:
Note that the *.moc files in the project aren't actual files, they exist only to provide the 
custom build step to build the moc_*.cpp files.  The moc*.cpp files are regenerated whenever 
the h file changes, so they shouldn't be put under source control.

Unix build instructions:
Nothing specific, except that the moc_* files are generated by the makefile.
