*Miles Help Fixes*

- AIL_set_3D_sample_effects_level() - The help does not mention the value range for "F32 effects_level". I assume it is [0..1]
- AIL_3D_sample_effects_level() - Does not mention the "RETURN" section like most functions do. Also the value range of the return value is not specified.

  crackling I get from buffering issues I guess? Can I increase some buffer length to alleviate these problems?
  My guess is that streaming music would not have this problem.
