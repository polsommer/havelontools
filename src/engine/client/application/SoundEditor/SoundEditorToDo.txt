* Sound Editor ToDo *

- Display sound length
- fix pitch
- Allow playing of all samples at once
- Check all combo boxes
- Bump full sound sample path.
- Possibly add some sort of hierarchy view.
- Re-think the layout of the SoundTemplateWidget. Since the first version was due to time constraints.
- Add close button to the upper right of the SoundTemplateWidget and SoundGroupTemplateWidget.
- Fix the size of the Widgets, so that resizing is not allowed?
