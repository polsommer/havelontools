This is the Linux port of miff.  See ../readme.txt for more information about miff.

To compile miff, run make in this directory.  (The compile may produce some warnings.)

To run miff, cpp must be in your path.  On most Linux systems, it is not in the path by default.  Typically it lives somewhere under /usr/lib/gcc-lib/.  Either make a link to it in /usr/local/bin, or add its location to your path.

Running miff with no arguments produces a list of the command line arguments.
